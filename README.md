### PCB conception on KiCad
> Circuit conception was made on KICAD. After doing the schematic, we draw the PCB with the previous dimensions :
> * Track length = 0.9 mm
> * Isolation width = 0.7 mm
> * Pad dimensions for OLED, Bluetooth module and rotary encoder = 2 mm * 2.5 mm
> * Drill size for OLED, bluetooth module, rotary encoder, AOP and digital potentiometer = 1 mm
> * Pad size for AOP and digital potentiometer = 1.8 mm * 2.5 mm
> * Drill size for resistances and capacities = 2 mm
> * Pad size for resistances and capacities = 0.8 mm
